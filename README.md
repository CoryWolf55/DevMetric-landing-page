# \## 📝 About

# 

# DevMetric was built to solve a common problem: developers have no standardized way to quantify their GitHub activity. We provide percentile-based rankings that give context to your contributions.

# 

# \*\*Why percentiles?\*\* Raw numbers don't tell the whole story. Being in the top 10% of developers your age is meaningful context for recruiters and yourself.

# 

# \## 🏗️ Development
