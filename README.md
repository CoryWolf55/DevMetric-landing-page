## 📝 About

DevMetric solves a common problem: developers lack a standardized way to quantify GitHub activity.

We use **percentile-based rankings** to provide meaningful context.

**Why percentiles?**  
Raw numbers don’t tell the full story. Being in the top 10% of developers in your age group gives recruiters and developers real perspective.

## 🏗️ Development

This is a **proprietary project**. The source code is closed, but the live demo is publicly available.
