## 📊 What is DevMetric?

DevMetric connects to your GitHub account and calculates a **DevMetric Score** based on 11 weighted metrics — commits, stars, languages, consistency, repo complexity, and more. You're then ranked by **percentile within your age bracket**, so you see how you compare against developers at a similar stage.

Raw commit counts don't tell the full story. Being in the **top 10% of developers your age** gives recruiters and developers real context.
